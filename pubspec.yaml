# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - assets/images/efficacy_Logo.png
      - assets/images/bg_bottom_layer.png
      - assets/images/bg_top_layer.png
      - assets/images/Pngtree_black default avatar_5407174.png
      - assets/images/iconlogo.png
      - assets/images/Events Empty Data Set.png
      - assets/images/facebook.png
      - assets/images/linkedinpng.png


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
    - family: CenturyGothic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CG.ttf
    - family: CGBold
      fonts:
